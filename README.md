Salve! 
Currently, i don't think that this project works since i've made it a long time ago and without experience, but i look forward to remake it in a better way.
It was made using the Raylib library (link here: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib ), in C, and the textures were ripped by me from youtube videos of the
minigame, hence the low quality.

To run the game, you should (in theory) first install the raylib library in your pc.
